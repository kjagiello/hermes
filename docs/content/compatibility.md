!!! warning "Compatibilty disclaimer"

    Hermes builds upon Argo Workflow's yet to be released support for [template
    executor plugins](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/pull/7256),
    which means that you will most likely not be able to use it in your cluster
    yet. If you still want to try Hermes out, you will have to build and
    install Argo Workflow from the PR.
